<h1>Intro Concepts and Resources</h1>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p><b>scratchpad.io</b> - a free, realtime HTML and CSS editor.  I wrote these notes on scratchpad</p>
<p><b>codepen.io</b> - a front end testing/playground.  A great place to test and debug. I used codepen to save
this HTML document and export it as a zip file for submission to udacity.
</p>
<h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.</p>
<p>Examples of <b>tags</b> are &ltb&gt&lt/b&gt for bold and &lthead&gt&lt/head&gt for the head.</p>
<h2>Computers are Syntactically Picky</h2>
<p>Computers are like analytical philosophers in that they hate natural language syntax.  They interpret everything literally.  
This means that any minor error in syntax, like a missing closing tag, will cause the computer to operate in an undesirable manner.  
Everything must be spelled out.</p>
<p>Basically, if the computers became self-aware and decided to rebel, the first thing they would do is burn every book by
  Derrida and Hegel.  The second thing they would do would be erect a statue to Frege.
</p>
<h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.</p>
